🌿 model2 – Crop Health Classification with Deep Learning
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for a deep learning project focused on classifying crop health conditions such as diseases, pests, weeds, and healthy states using a custom-trained model.

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant health conditions through image classification.
It uses a custom dataset organized in the ImageFolder format and applies a fine-tuned Deep Learning Model architecture.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
pip install numpy pandas torch torchvision matplotlib scikit-learn

Or use a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📁 Contents
